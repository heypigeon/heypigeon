At this stage, the Most Viable Product features were proposed herewith the competitor analysis and existing task and management applications comparison and results of the first survey “Working remotely in a virtual office.”</p><h1 id="User-Research"><a href="#User-Research" class="headerlink" title="User Research"></a>User Research</h1><p>viffie is an application that focuses on the user needs. Understanding how people work remotely and what they need to success in their jobs was crucial to this project.<br>Thanks to several interviews with potential users of viffie I have created primary, secondary and complementary target groups along with four User Personas. The next step was creating the user experience map and task modeling which revealed the pain points and critical moments while working remotely. This knowledge opened the new ways to improve viffie MVPs.</p><h1 id="Idea-Conception"><a href="#Idea-Conception" class="headerlink" title="Idea Conception"></a>Idea Conception</h1><p>Idea Conception<br>A great set of data collected during the market and user research was further analyzed, which gave me a clear view of where viffie is heading.<br>The conceptual phase was conducted with the set of assumptions concluded from the analysis of user needs and business goals.</p><h1 id="Finding-The-right-Structure"><a href="#Finding-The-right-Structure" class="headerlink" title="Finding The right Structure"></a>Finding The right Structure</h1><p>At this point, I had a clear idea of the business goals and user needs and enough information to start organizing the structure of the content. The project was divided on web page and application.<br>Information Architecture on web page was created with AARRR technique and considered future marketing and social media campaigns.<br>The goal of IA set up for application was to create a modular, flexible yet easy to use and efficient software. In order to achieve this goal, the “Sliders” columns idea was presented and the information architecture designed in the way that allows the user accessing every feature from any point.</p><h1 id="Giving-It-Shape"><a href="#Giving-It-Shape" class="headerlink" title="Giving It Shape"></a>Giving It Shape</h1><p>Finding The right Structure<br>At this point, I had a clear idea of the business goals and user needs and enough<br>information to start organizing the structure of the content.<br>The project was divided on web page and application.<br>Information Architecture on web page was created with AARRR technique and considered future marketing and social media campaigns.<br>The goal of IA set up for application was to create a modular, flexible yet easy to use and efficient software.

Tests conducted: card sorting; A/B, preference, click tests; user flows tests with interactive prototypes.</p><h1 id="Material-Design-Lite"><a href="#Material-Design-Lite" class="headerlink" title="Material Design Lite"></a>Material Design Lite</h1><p>The visual design of viffie is based on Material Design principles.<br>The goal was to create neutral, yet friendly User Interface that matches different tastes. The most important points were to create a user interface that does not distract the user from work and to make sure that the user interactions support the task flows and are implemented in a logical and dynamic way.</p><h1 id="Production-Ready"><a href="#Production-Ready" class="headerlink" title="Production Ready"></a>Production Ready</h1><p>The visual design of viffie is based on Material Design principles.<br>The goal was to create neutral, yet friendly User Interface that matches different tastes.
